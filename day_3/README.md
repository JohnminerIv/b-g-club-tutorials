Volunteers to be a TA for today?



## Main Activity

Today we'll be starting with classes, which are an easy way of organizing code. \
This section will also cover methods and the __init__ method. Then we'll use the \
classes to help polish our debuging skills.

For the rest of our time I want you all to talk to each other about what 

## Challenge

Your goal is to create a command line tic tac toe program. When you run the \

7. Repeat steps 3-6 until a player wins
