## Main Activity

Today we'll be starting with functions, which are an easy way of encapsuling code.

Next we'll be moving on to function parameters, and type annotations

Now we'll move onto the if_main file

Next lets look at the imports file.

## Challenge

Your goal is to create a command line tic tac toe program. When you run the \
srcipt it should:

1. Ask if player1 wants to be x or o
2. Display an ascii board
3. prompt player 1 for a move
4. Display what the new ascii board looks like

6. Display what the new ascii board looks like
7. Repeat steps 3-6 until a player wins 
8. Display a winning screen and prompt the players to play again, if they say yes repeat step 1-8 if no end the program.

Place your code in the
