# Day 1

## Warm up

Shoulder stretches
Neck stretches
20 jumping jacks

Names and one cool fact about you

The goal of this club is to make a portfolio project.

6 sessions of basic coding knowledge and 6 session to work on the porfolio porject.

For the first six sessions, we'll go through some explainations of concepts then \
build a small project in teams of 2, applying what you learned.

For the portfolio projects you'll work in team of three to design build and \
implement your own project.

How much coding expireince do you have, what languages have you used and what \
projects have you built? It's fine if you don't know any languages or haven't \
built any project yet.

Are there any volunteers to be assitants? If you volunteer you won't be able to \
do the challenge problems, you'll have to help me answer questions that any \
pairs may have while they are solving the challenge. 

Volunteer to be a questioner.


## Main Activity
Lets start off with the simple stuff for those of you who are not as familiar \
with coding. We'll be starting with assigning and using variables today.

Let's open up vars.py

Alright, that may have been a little confusing, does anyone have any questions?

Lets move on to types.py

Any questions?

Lets move on to ifs.py

Any questions?

Moving on to loops.py

Any questions?


## Challenge

Your goal is to create a commandline calculator program. This program should \ 
request a number, a math sign, and another number. Then it will return the \
result and ask if you want to do another calculation, if you say yes it should \
repeat the process if not it should stop.


Hint 1: You can use the input() function to get input from the commandline.
Hint 2: You will probably have to use if statements to decide what math sign to use
Hint 3: You'll probably have to use a loop to keep repeating the process until \
the person no longer wants to do a calculation
